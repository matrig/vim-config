My Vim configuration
====================

This folder has my vim configuration. I don't have any kind of write-up where I explain it, but fortunately the internet abounds with good vim resources.
Clone with:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/matrig/vim-config.git

(`--recursive` is necessary in order to close the submodules containing the external packages).
